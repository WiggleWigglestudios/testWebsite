				Cuphead is one of the best games in my (Breck's) opinion. Cuphead falls under many categories such as indie game, shoot em up, platformer, and run and gun. Cuphead has a unique style that may make you think it is a 1930s cartoon. Cupheadâ€™s art consists of 50,000 hand drawn frames! Their music is a nice fast pace swing jazz that comes from the 1930s.

		Don't let this cool/unique art style fool you. This game is extremely challenging. The game has 19 different bosses, 6 run and gun levels, and three different islands. I have had the game for 2 years and I still haven't come close to beating the game. While the game can be quickly speed runned for the average person the game is a test of their patients. You will die hundreds and hundreds of times. The game is very frustrating but the satisfaction of finally beating a boss makes up for it.

			The game has 2 different playable characters, Cuphead and Mugman. In future there might be one more playable character but as of now these are the only 2 playable characters.
